* [Metamask(Chrome Extension)](https://metamask.io/)

## Deployment

You may use Metamask or testrpc (or some other tool) to deploy a test network. Using testrpc provides a quick way to play with 10 test accounts with 100 ethers each.

We have made a SmartContract in a filename with extension .sol (filename.sol) using solidity language which has been designed to design the smartcontract easily.

The Filename.sol is compiled with help of solc compiler.Solc compiler has been designed to compile the SmartContract code.

After Compiling the SmartContract, it is deployed with the help of web3.js library and a key is generated which is copied in main.js file in which code has been written to create interaction between ethereum network(testrpc/ganache-cli) and smartContract.

The UserInterface(FrontEnd) has been connected with backEnd through Html file.
The FrontEnd has been designed with help of css,bootstrap,and little bit javascript code.
